So I blasted through making backgrounds for this. They aren't imported from anywhere and you can't add your own yet, which is a little lame, but honestly my priorities are elsewhere, seeing as I haven't even started on polar coordinates.

But yeah, I took an easy week for Thanksgiving, and made the backgrounds fit to the size of the canvas so it doesn't look terrible or squashed.

Going to finish making the page nice quickly (read: minimalist) and then start on polar coordinates.

I'll probably post another update on Tuesday or some time else this week.
