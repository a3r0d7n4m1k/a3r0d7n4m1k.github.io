Hello! My project is the Graffiti Grapher, a tool that allows people to explore the way Cartesian and polar coordinates can be used to describe and recreate one of the four facets of hip-hop: graffiti!

I've always been interested in graffiti, and was really excited to get started on the project. Since I'm converting an existing Flash app to JavaScript, my first assignment was to just get familiar with what I was recreating. I used it to (loosely) recreate a piece. Then I got started using the HTML <canvas> and wrote my name using different shapes and line styles.

This week, I've been working mostly on getting text input working. At the time of writing, it only works for line input, but I don't anticipate trouble expanding to rectangles and other polygons.

Thanks for reading!
